# ASCAT Data #

## Introduction ## 

For ASCAT data we have the soil moisture Product available: The Soil Moisture (SM) product is derived from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) backscatter observations and given in swath orbit geometry (25 km sampling). This SM product provides an estimate of the water content of the 0-5 cm topsoil layer, expressed in degree of saturation between 0 and 100 %.
